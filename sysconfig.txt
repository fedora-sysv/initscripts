Files in /etc/sysconfig
=======================

/etc/sysconfig/clock:

  deprecated values from earlier releases:

    CLOCKMODE=GMT indicates that the clock is set to UTC
    CLOCKMODE=ARC on alpha only indicates the ARC console's
      42-year time offset is in effect

  currently correct values:

    UTC=true indicates that the clock is set to UTC; anything
      else indicates that it is set to local time
    ARC=true on alpha only indicates the ARC console's
      42-year time offset is in effect; otherwise the normal
      Unix epoch is assumed


/etc/sysconfig/keyboard:

  KEYTABLE=<keytable file>
  for example: KEYTABLE="/usr/lib/kbd/keytables/us.map"

/etc/sysconfig/mouse:

  MOUSETYPE=microsoft|mouseman|mousesystems|ps/2|msbm|logibm|atibm|
    logitech|mmseries|mmhittab
  XEMU3=yes|no (emulate three buttons with two buttons whenever
    necessary, most notably in X)

  In addition, /dev/mouse points to the mouse device.

/etc/sysconfig/network:

  NETWORKING=yes|no
  HOSTNAME=<fqdn by default, but whatever hostname you want>
    Note: for compatibility with some old software people might
    install (like trn), the /etc/HOSTNAME file should contain the
    same value as here.
  FORWARD_IPV4=yes|no (The current Red Hat Linux installation
    sets this to no by default for RFC compliance, but if
    FORWARD_IPV4 is not set at all, forwarding is *enabled*
    for compatibility with the configuration files used on
    Red Hat Linux versions 4.2 and earlier.)
  GATEWAY=<gateway IP>
  GATEWAYDEV=<gateway device> (e.g. eth0)
  NISDOMAIN=<nis domain name>

/etc/sysconfig/static-routes:

  Contains lines of the form:

    <device> net <network> netmask <netmask> gw <gateway>

  <device> may be a device name to have the route brought up and
  down with the device, or "any" to have the correct devices calculated
  at run time.

/etc/sysconfig/pcmcia:

  PCMCIA=yes|no
  PCIC=i82365|tcic
  PCIC_OPTS=<socket driver (i82365 or tcic) timing parameters>
  CORE_OPTS=<pcmcia_core options>
  CARDMGR_OPTS=<cardmgr options>

/etc/sysconfig/amd:

  ADIR=/.automount  (normally never changed)
  MOUNTPTS='/net /etc/amd.conf'  (standard automount stuff)
  AMDOPTS=  (extra options for AMD)

/etc/sysconfig/tape:

  DEV=/dev/nst0
    Tape device.  Use the non-rewinding one for these scripts.
  
    For SCSI tapes this is /dev/nst#, where # is the number of the
    tape drive you want to use.  If you only have one then use
    nst0.
 
    For IDE tapes you use /dev/ht#, where # is the number of the tape
    drive you want to use (usually ht0).
 
    For floppy tape drives use /dev/ftape.

  ADMIN=root
    Person to mail to if the backup fails for any reason

  SLEEP=5
    Time to sleep between tape operations.  Some drives need a bit
    more than others, but 5 seems to work for 8mm, 4mm, and DLT

  BLOCKSIZE=32768
    This worked fine for 8mm, then 4mm, and now DLT.  An optimal
    setting is probably however much data your drive writes at one
    time.

  SHORTDATE=$(date +%y:%m:%d:%H:%M)
    A short date string, used in backup log filenames.

  DAY=$(date +log-%y:%m:%d)
    This is used for the log file directory.

  DATE=$(date)
    Regular date string, used in log files.

  LOGROOT=/var/log/backup
    Root of the logging directory

  LIST=$LOGROOT/incremental-list
    This is the file name the incremental backup will use to store
    the incremental list.  It will be $LIST-{some number}.

  DOTCOUNT=$LOGROOT/.count
    For counting as you go to know which incremental list to use

  COUNTER=$LOGROOT/counter-file
    For rewinding when done...might not use.

  BACKUPTAB=/etc/backuptab
    The file in which we keep our list of backup(s) we want to make.



Files in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
========================================

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup:
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifdown:

  Symlinks to /sbin/ifup and /sbin/ifdown, respectively.
  These are the only two scripts "in" this directory that should
  be called directly; these two scripts call all the other
  scripts as needed.  These symlinks are here for legacy purposes
  only -- they'll will probably be removed in future versions, so
  only /sbin/ifup and /sbin/ifdown should currently be used.

  These scripts take one argument normally: the name of the device
  (e.g. eth0).  They are called with a second argument of "boot"
  during the boot sequence so that devices that are not meant to
  be brought up on boot (ONBOOT=no, see below) can be ignored at
  that time.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/network-functions:

  Not really a public file.  Contains functions which the scripts use
  for bringing interfaces up and down.  In particular, it contains
  most of the code for handling alternative interface configurations
  and interface change notification through netreport.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface-name> and
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface-name>-<clone-name>:

  The first defines an interface, and the second contains
  only the parts of the definition that are different in a
  "clone" (or alternative) interface.  For example, the
  network numbers might be different, but everything else
  might be the same, so only the network numbers would be
  in the clone file, but all the device information would
  be in the base ifcfg file.

  The items that can be defined in an ifcfg file depend on the
  interface type.  The really obvious ones I'm not going to
  bother to define; you can figure out what "IPADDR" is, I
  think...  :-)

  Base items:
    DEVICE=<name of physical device (except dynamically-allocated PPP
      devices where it is the "logical name")
    IPADDR=
    NETMASK=
    GATEWAY=
    ONBOOT=yes|no
    USERCTL=yes|no
    BOOTPROTO=none|bootp|dhcp

  If BOOTPROTO is not "none", then the only other item that
  must be set is the DEVICE item; all the rest will be determined
  by the boot protocol.  No "dummy" entries need to be created.

  Base items being deprecated:
    NETWORK=<will be calculated automatically with ifcalc>
    BROADCAST=<will be calculated automatically with ifcalc>

  PPP/SLIP items:
    PERSIST=yes|no
    MODEMPORT=<device, say /dev/modem>
    LINESPEED=<speed, say 115200>
    DEFABORT=yes|no (tells netcfg whether or not to put default
      abort strings in when creating/editing the chat script and/or
      dip script for this interface)
 
  PPP-specific items
    DEFROUTE=yes|no (set this interface as default route?)
    ESCAPECHARS=yes|no (simplified interface here doesn't let people
      specify which characters to escape; almost everyone can use
      asyncmap 00000000 anyway, and they can set PPPOPTIONS to
      asyncmap foobar if they want to set options perfectly)
    HARDFLOWCTL=yes|no (yes imples "modem crtscts" options)
    PPPOPTIONS=<arbitrary option string; is placed last on the
      command line, so it can override other options like asyncmap
      that were specified differently>
    PAPNAME=<"name $PAPNAME" on pppd command line> (note that
      the "remotename" option is always specified as the logical
      ppp device name, like "ppp0" (which might perhaps be the
      physical device ppp1 if some other ppp device was brought
      up earlier...), which makes it easy to manage pap/chap
      files -- name/password pairs are associated with the
      logical ppp device name so that they can be managed
      together.

      In principal, I'm not aware of anything that would keep
      the logical PPP device names from being "worldnet" or
      "myISP" instead of ppp0-pppN)
    REMIP=<remote ip address, normally unspecified>
    MTU=
    MRU=
    DISCONNECTTIMEOUT=<number of seconds, default currently 5>
      (time to wait before re-establishing the connection after
      a successfully-connected session terminates before attempting
      to establish a new connection.)
    RETRYTIMEOUT=<number of seconds, default currently 60>
      (time to wait before re-attempting to establish a connection
      after a previous attempt fails.)

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/chat-<interface-name>:

  chat script for PPP or SLIP connection intended to establish
  the connection.  For SLIP devices, a DIP script is written
  from the chat script; for PPP devices, the chat script is used
  directly.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/dip-<interface-name>

  A write-only script created from the chat script by netcfg.
  Do not modify this.  In the future, this file may disappear
  by default and created on-the-fly from the chat script if
  it does not exist.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-post

  Called when any network device EXCEPT a SLIP device comes
  up.  Calls /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-routes to
  bring up static routes that depend on that device.  Brings
  up aliases for that device.  Sets the hostname if it is not
  already set and a hostname can be found for the IP for that
  device.  Sends SIGIO to any programs that have requested
  notification of network events.

  Could be extended to fix up nameservice configuration, call
  arbitrary scripts, etc, as needed.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifdhcpc-done

  Called by dhcpcd once dhcp configuration is complete; sets
  up /etc/resolv.conf from the version dhcpcd dropped in
  /etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf
