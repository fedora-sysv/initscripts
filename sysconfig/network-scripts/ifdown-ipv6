# Version 2002-10-30
#
# Note: if called as (like normally) by /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifdown
#        exit codes aren't handled by "ifdown"
#
# Uses following information from /etc/sysconfig/network:
#  NETWORKING_IPV6=yes|no: controls IPv6 initialization (global setting)
#
# Uses following information from /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-$1:
#  DEVICE=<device>
#  IPV6INIT=yes|no: controls IPv6 configuration for this interface
#
# Optional for 6to4 tunneling:
#  IPV6TO4_RELAY=<IPv4 address>: IPv4 address of the remote 6to4 relay [default: 192.88.99.1]
#  IPV6TO4_ROUTING="<device>-<suffix>/<prefix length> ...": information to setup local subnetting
#
# Optional for 6to4 tunneling links to trigger radvd:
#  IPV6_CONTROL_RADVD=yes|no: controls radvd triggering [optional]
#  IPV6_RADVD_PIDFILE=<file>: PID file of radvd for sending signals, default is "/var/run/radvd/radvd.pid" [optional]
#  IPV6_RADVD_TRIGGER_ACTION=startstop|reload|restart|SIGHUP: how to trigger radvd [optional, default is SIGHUP]
#
#  Required version of radvd to use 6to4 prefix recalculation
#   0.6.2p3 or newer supporting option "Base6to4Interface"
#  Required version of radvd to use dynamic ppp links
#   0.7.0 + fixes or newer
